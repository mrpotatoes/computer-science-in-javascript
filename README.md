This is my personal reference for computer science (w/o the math sadly) with all the code written in `JavaScript`. I use it as both a study guide and a reference. Everything written is in a casual voice.

## Attributions
### Credits
1. Not all of this code is my own. In those cases I will note it within the code and any `README` files referencing said code. Like I said this is just a repo for me to learn, re-learn, or to setup as a reference for myself.
1. For all code or articles written within this repo, for which I have put in considerable effort, it needs to be known that I used many sources for **EVERY** article or code bit. I wanted to be as extensive as possible and I cited *everything* I used.
