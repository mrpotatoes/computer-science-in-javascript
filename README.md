This is my personal reference for computer science (w/o the math sadly) with all the code written in `JavaScript`. I use it as both a study guide and a reference. Everything written is in a casual voice.

## Attributions
### Credits
1. Not all of this code is my own. In those cases I will note it within the code and any `README` files referencing said code. Like I said this is just a repo for me to learn, re-learn, or to setup as a reference for myself.
1. For all code or articles written within this repo, for which I have put in considerable effort, it needs to be known that I used many sources for **EVERY** article or code bit. I wanted to be as extensive as possible and I cited *everything* I used.

## Todos
- [ ] Recreate all the diagrams into my own (draw.io)
- [x] ~~Reorganize `./philosophies/`~~
  - [x] ~~Branch: `feature/reorg-docs`~~
  - [x] ~~`./philosophies/` → `./docs`~~
- [x] ~~Rename all `README.md` files to `index.md` except for root one~~
- [x] ~~Merge `system-design/designing-applications/topics/` with `./philosophies/system-design/core/`~~
- [x] ~~Redo the tables in `designing-applications/` `README.md` so it doesn't look so wierd~~
