This is my personal reference for computer science (w/o the math sadly) with all the code written in `JavaScript`. It [will] build[s] to a [`Hugo`](https://gohugo.io/) powered static generator using the [`Docsy`](https://www.docsy.dev/) theme with some custom shortcodes. It is meant to store everything I've learned and even some stuff that I find interesting. I find it useful as a study guide and I hope everyone else that finds this repo does as well.

I use it as both a study guide and a reference.

## What this repo is not
1. A cheat sheet
    * This is a personal reference guide that I'm making public for anyone else to learn from
    * Not meant to accommodate any specific language.
1. A reference guide or how-to for setups of different techs.
1. Production ready code.
    * This is for learning/referencing not to reuse professionally.
# Notes
1. Everything written is meant to sound casual and not professional. 
1. Will be converting to use [`Hugo`](https://gohugo.io/) for static site generation and hosting on GitHub pages
1. Project assumes you have `node` and `npm/yarn` installed. If not go ahead and do that now.pa
1. I'm using: [Babel Namespace Plugin](https://github.com/yudhasetiawan/babel-plugin-namespace)
    * This is important so I don't need to keep typing `../../`. It isn't 1980 anymore.
    * This might not be nessessary since I'm not using `Rollup` to run this code locally.

## Attributions
### Credits
1. Not all of this code is my own. In those cases I will note it within the code and any `README` files referencing said code. Like I said this is just a repo for me to learn, re-learn, or to setup as a reference for myself.
1. For all code or articles written within this repo, for which I have put in considerable effort, it needs to be known that I used many sources for **EVERY** article or code bit. I wanted to be as extensive as possible and I cited *everything* I used.
