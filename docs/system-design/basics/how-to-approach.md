# How to approach a system design interview question
> How to tackle a system design interview question.

The system design interview is an **open-ended conversation**.  You are expected to lead it.

You can use the following steps to guide the discussion.  To help solidify this process, work through the [System design interview questions with solutions](#system-design-interview-questions-with-solutions) section using the following steps.

- [Step 1: Outline use cases, constraints, and assumptions](#step-1-outline-use-cases-constraints-and-assumptions)
- [Step 2: Create a high level design](#step-2-create-a-high-level-design)
- [Step 3: Design core components](#step-3-design-core-components)
- [Step 4: Scale the design](#step-4-scale-the-design)
- [Back-of-the-envelope calculations](#back-of-the-envelope-calculations)
- [Source(s) and further reading](#sources-and-further-reading)

## Step 1: Outline use cases, constraints, and assumptions
Gather requirements and scope the problem.  Ask questions to clarify use cases and constraints.  Discuss assumptions.

* Who is going to use it?
* How are they going to use it?
* How many users are there?
* What does the system do?
* What are the inputs and outputs of the system?
* How much data do we expect to handle?
* How many requests per second do we expect?
* What is the expected read to write ratio?

## Step 2: Create a high level design
Outline a high level design with all important components.

* Sketch the main components and connections
* Justify your ideas

## Step 3: Design core components
Dive into details for each core component.  For example, if you were asked to [design a url shortening service](solutions/system_design/pastebin/README.md), discuss:

* Generating and storing a hash of the full url
    * [MD5](solutions/system_design/pastebin/README.md) and [Base62](solutions/system_design/pastebin/README.md)
    * Hash collisions
    * SQL or NoSQL
    * Database schema
* Translating a hashed url to the full url
    * Database lookup
* API and object-oriented design

## Step 4: Scale the design
Identify and address bottlenecks, given the constraints.  For example, do you need the following to address scalability issues?

* Load balancer
* Horizontal scaling
* Caching
* Database sharding

Discuss potential solutions and trade-offs.  Everything is a trade-off.  Address bottlenecks using [principles of scalable system design](#index-of-system-design-topics).

## Back-of-the-envelope calculations
You might be asked to do some estimates by hand.  Refer to the [Appendix](#appendix) for the following resources:

* [Use back of the envelope calculations](http://highscalability.com/blog/2011/1/26/google-pro-tip-use-back-of-the-envelope-calculations-to-choo.html)
* [Powers of two table](#powers-of-two-table)
