# Back of envelope calculations

## Byte Calculator
I refuse to remember the formula to convert bytes. It's a dumb thing to memorize. Besides it's not like we live in a world bereft of [tools](https://calcuworld.com/business-calculators/bytes-calculator/) (online or otherise) that exist for free that can handle these conversions. It is simply not useful to keep this in my brain just for doing these calculations for `Back of envelope calculations`.
