# Heaps & Priority Queues

## What
> A heap is a tree-like data structure where each node must be ordered with respect to the value of its children. This ordering must persist throughout the entire heap. Put simply, a parent node’s value must always be greater (or less) than its children’s values. There are two types of heap: max heap and min heap. As you may have guessed, in a max heap, parent node values are greater than those of their children, whereas the opposite is true in a min heap - [Implementing a Complete Binary Heap in JavaScript: The Priority Queue, Mike Peritz,]()
