/**
 * Create a binary heap using a priority queue (array). Min Heap version.
 *
 * An interesting bit is that the children of the parent aren't required to
 * have it's nodes in the same order as a binary search tree and it will also
 * allow duplicates. For instance if the values to be added are [ 19, 16, 26 ]
 * the resulting heap will be [ 0, 16, 19, 26 ]. If the values passed in are
 * slightly different ([ 19, 26, 16 ]) the resulting heap will be thus
 * [ 0, 16, 26, 19 ]. This is okay as we want the levels below the parent node
 * to be greater than the parent but the level order needed be in a specific
 * order and repetitions are allowed.
 *
 * O(log n) â†’ because we need to iterate through the entire array
 *
 * @param {int[]} heap The heap to be modified
 * @param {int} val The value to insert into the heap
 *
 * @returns The modified heap.
