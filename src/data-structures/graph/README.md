# How it works
Explain how the algo works. 

# Exercises
* Add & Remove vertex
* Add & Remove edge
* How many vertices? How many edges?
* Depth first search
* Breadth first search
* Print out the path from Vertex x to Vertex Y
* Test your code (Unit tests)
    * [9, 2, 5, 6, 4, 3, 7, 10, 1, 8]
    * [10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0, -10]
    * [1, -10]
    * [10]
* Make sure to draw a multi-step diagram of how the method works.
