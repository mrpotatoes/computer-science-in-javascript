 * 0. First thing's first.
 *    If no tree then we do not do anything. We just return the tree/null and
 *    early bail.
 *
 * 1. Delete a node with 0 children
 *    If node has no children we will delete the current node and set it's
 *    parent child pointer (left or right) to null.
 * 2. Delete a node with 1 child
 *    Now, if the node has 1 child we'll delete the current node and set the the
 *    parent's child pointer (left or right) to the existing child
 * 3. Delete a node with 2 children
 *    Lastly we need to handle the case where there are multiple children
 *    attached to the current node. This one is a bit more tricky.
 *
 *    We need to delete the node in such a fashion where we maintain the
 *    properties of a BST. It needs to stay sorted.
 *
 *    Inorder successor is needed only when the right child is not empty. In
 *    this particular case, the inorder successor can be obtained by finding the
 *    minimum value in the right child of the node.
 *
 *    The inorder successor is the left-most node on the right subtree of the
 *    current node. Or it's the smallest value within the current tree/node.
