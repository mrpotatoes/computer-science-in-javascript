# [Heading](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Array_data_structure)
In computer science, an array data structure, or simply an array, is a data structure consisting of a collection of elements (values or variables), each identified by at least one array index or key. An array is stored so that the position of each element can be computed from its index tuple by a mathematical formula. The simplest type of data structure is a linear array, also called one-dimensional array.

Example (all are ints): `[1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8][9]`

# Exercises
* Write the binary search.
* Test your code (Unit tests)
    * [9, 2, 5, 6, 4, 3, 7, 10, 1, 8]
    * [10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0, -10]
    * [1, -10]
    * [10]
* Make sure to draw a multi-step diagram of how the method works.
