   * allow duplicates. For instance if the values to be added are [ 19, 16, 26 ]
   * the resulting heap will be [ 0, 16, 19, 26 ]. If the values passed in are
   * slightly different ([ 19, 26, 16 ]) the resulting heap will be thus
   * [ 0, 16, 26, 19 ]. This is okay as we want the levels below the parent node
   * to be greater than the parent but the level order needed be in a specific
   * order and repetitions are allowed.
   *
   * O(log n) â†’ because we need to iterate through the entire array
