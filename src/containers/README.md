*Notes*: This directory won't have any actual working code or tests. 

# Containers
Explain how containers work and show a working example. Use Kubernetes.

# TODO
Move any directories that don't contain working code to their own shared directory.

Perhaps to root and be under src.

Don't know what it should be called though.

Should prolly make this it's own repo.
