# Bit Shifting - Thoughts
As JavaScript becomes more ubiquitous and powerful the more seriously it will be taken.
Therefore if we plan to become better software engineers we must then learn more about
and become more efficient with bitwise operators and bit shifting and all that awful nonsense.

While the readability is awful, just, just awful, it is very powerful and often faster than
standard libraries. So in here I have a bunch of different methods that utilize one operation
and the tests are located in the `tests/bit-shifting` directory.

| OPERATOR  | DESCRIPTION  |
|---|---|
| `&` | Bitwise AND |
| `\|` | Bitwise OR |
| `~` | Bitwise NOT |
| `^` | Bitwise XOR |
| `<<` | Bitwise left shift |
| `>>` | Bitwise right shift |
| `>>>` | Bitwise unsigned right shift |
| `&=` | Bitwise AND assignment |
| `\|=` | Bitwise OR assignment |
| `^=` | Bitwise XOR assignment |
| `<<=` | Bitwise left shift and assignment |
| `>>=` | Bitwise right shift and assignment |
| `>>>=` | Bitwise unsigned right shift and assignment |
