> In object-oriented programming, the command pattern is a behavioral design pattern in which an object is used to encapsulate all information needed to perform an action or trigger an event at a later time. This information includes the method name, the object that owns the method and values for the method parameters. - Wikipedia

Command decouples the object that invokes the operation from the one that knows how to perform it. Basically the command pattern [black] boxes up all needed functionality to take an action and it is completely independent of any context from the caller.
