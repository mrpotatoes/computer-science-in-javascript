# Designing APIs and Architectures
Look to explain the highlevel concepts of DDD and architectures.

Examples
* REST
* HyperMedia
* DDD
* CQRS
* Event Sourcing
* Microservices
* Code APIs (naming, organization et al)

# TODO
Move any directories that don't contain working code to their own shared directory.

Perhaps to root and be under src.

Don't know what it should be called though.

Should prolly make this it's own repo.
